        <p>Wrapping the Windows API for PHP
WAFP (Win API For PHP) is a group of extensions written for PHP that allow PHP users access to the large underlying C library that Windows developers typically enjoy. The extensions aim to provide a clean and intelligent OO and namespaced API for PHP users.</p>

<p>Namespacing
The API exposes 3 main namespaces, each of which groups part of the Windows API. One problem with the Windows API is its complete lack of modularity - you really don't want to know how messy it is. We could've just copied the structure (if you can call it that), function-for-function - it would have sure made it easier - but then it wouldn't be much fun to use. While we're here writing the code, we might as well improve upon it. And there sits one of our key objectives: clean and intelligent!</p>

<p>Win\Gdi
Under this namespace lies the code for the GDI API. You can write code to create bitmaps; draw shapes, paths, lines; create colors; grab device contexts to draw on; write text -- all the stuff you can do with GDI.</p>

<p>Win\Gui
A possibly more controversial library, the Win\Gui namespace opens up a bunch of code for creating windowed applications for your desktop. PHP is no longer a web-only language, although some people stuck in the past may say otherwise. PHP is equipped for long-running desktop applications using its garbage-collection cycles. So, from PHP, create all the widgets you could using C and the Windows API.</p>

<p>Win\System
This is the namespace that holds all the other cool stuff of the Win API. You have access to things like Unicode, Threading, Events, Timers, and much more!</p>
