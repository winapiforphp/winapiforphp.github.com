The scripts in this directory are helpers for the website.  If you're running
a local copy changes are you won't need any of this.  Below are my own notes.

pull.sh is a simple script to update the website once a day
requires a checkout of the website

hg clone https://[username]@bitbucket.org/winapiforphp/web winapiforphp.net
chmod u+x pull.sh
crontab -e
