{"name":"Winapiforphp.github.io","tagline":"Website for http://phpforwinapi.net","body":"Wrapping the Windows API for PHP\r\nWAFP (Win API For PHP) is a group of extensions written for PHP that allow PHP users access to the large underlying C library that Windows developers typically enjoy. The extensions aim to provide a clean and intelligent OO and namespaced API for PHP users.\r\n\r\nNamespacing\r\nThe API exposes 3 main namespaces, each of which groups part of the Windows API. One problem with the Windows API is its complete lack of modularity - you really don't want to know how messy it is. We could've just copied the structure (if you can call it that), function-for-function - it would have sure made it easier - but then it wouldn't be much fun to use. While we're here writing the code, we might as well improve upon it. And there sits one of our key objectives: clean and intelligent!\r\n\r\nWin\\Gdi\r\nUnder this namespace lies the code for the GDI API. You can write code to create bitmaps; draw shapes, paths, lines; create colors; grab device contexts to draw on; write text -- all the stuff you can do with GDI.\r\n\r\nWin\\Gui\r\nA possibly more controversial library, the Win\\Gui namespace opens up a bunch of code for creating windowed applications for your desktop. PHP is no longer a web-only language, although some people stuck in the past may say otherwise. PHP is equipped for long-running desktop applications using its garbage-collection cycles. So, from PHP, create all the widgets you could using C and the Windows API.\r\n\r\nWin\\System\r\nThis is the namespace that holds all the other cool stuff of the Win API. You have access to things like Unicode, Threading, Events, Timers, and much more!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
